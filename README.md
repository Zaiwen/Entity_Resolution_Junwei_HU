# When GDD meets GNN: A Knowledge-driven Neural Connection for Effective Entity Resolution
Entity Resolution(ER) is the process of identifying and linking different records that refer to the same real-world entity. It is commonly used in data integration, data cleansing, fraud detection, and other applications where it is important to have accurate and consistent data. This work investigates the ER problem in property graphs. Our proposed ER framework is divided into three parts: blocking, pruning, and matching. As shown in the following figure.
